# Genetic Programing Homework
I've provided two homework worksheets that you should look through. You only have to turn in one, but I think they're both fun! 

For the CartPole worksheet, you're solving a dynamical control problem (kind of like controlling a robot). For the Symbolic Regression worksheet, you're trying to find the underlying function that produced some data I've provided. Note that in real-world applications, you wouldn't necessarily have any ground truth and instead have to evaluate how good your solutions are based on their performance.

Feel free to work in groups, but I encourage each of you to try working through one of the two worksheets on your own as well. Turn in whatever you worked on, and if it is a group submission include a note about your and your group mate's contributions. 

## Rough Rubric
- 5/10 - Implement Tournament Selection and a working Fitness Function
- 8/10 - The above plus more tailored Mutation Function(s)
- 10/10 - Implementing at least one advanced feature, such as fitness sharing (niching), adaptive fitness evaluations or mutations
