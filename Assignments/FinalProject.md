# Evolution *in silico* Final Project
Just before spring break seems like the right time to begin thinking about what really fun project you all might want to work on when you get back. 

This project is your chance to explore a topic we've talked about in more depth than we had time for during class. It's a chance for you to try your hand at using evolution to solve a problem with relevance to your research or your life. It could also just be an excuse to learn more about interactive web programing, for example, if your group chooses to develop a *lesson* covering one of the topics you found interesting during the course. 

For the more adventurous, this could easily be turned into a publication-level research project pushing the boundaries of Evolution *in silico*. This is by no means my expectation of your projects, though. 

## Description
The projects will be broken up into three equally weighted components: The Supporting Work, The Implementation, and The Presentation. What each of these components looks like depends on the type of project the group is working on.

### Supporting Work (10 pt)
In order to work on a project that goes into more depth than we had time to cover in class, groups will have to turn to books and/or research articles about the topic they're working on. Maintaining a **literature survey** is the easiest way to keep track of this component of the project, and is the easiest way for your groups to take advantage of *distributed human computation*. 

*For each group, this should be a written document with proper citations (I don't have a preference on citation styles).*

### Implementation (10 pt)
You may use any programing language or tools you like for the project implementation. For groups using existing tools (e.g., Avida), the implementation component involves designing an experiment and doing the data collection/processing rather than developing new programs. In either case, you should be keeping track of what the group has been doing either with code (and documentation), or a writeup of the experimental design and configurations/data you all are collecting.

### Presentation (10 pt)
By presentation, I mean how you package and convey the work your group did. This could take on many forms, depending on your projects. For example, an interactive website is already a presentation of the work, but for a group using Avida and doing experiments, presenting the results would require a more traditional approach (figures, slides, a writeup etc).

### Final Project Symposium
We will use the final exam time to share the group projects  with each other (~10 - 15 minute presentations). Other Complex Systems faculty will probably be interested in the projects you pick, and will be invited to your presentations! I'll try to get Complex Systems to buy Pizza ;). 

The Final Exam slot for this class is on Tuesday, April 30th from 1:30 pm - 3:30 pm.

## Some (Half Baked) Example Ideas
#### These are just some ideas, feel free to be creative here. Let me know if you have any questions as you brainstorm different project ideas! 

- Formulate and test a biological hypothesis about evolution using Evolution *in silico* (e.g., Avida or simulated robots). 

- Build an interactive web-based lesson targeted to the general public (e.g., little to no evolutionary biology knowledge) about a really interesting topic, implementation, or algorithm we learned about in class. 

- Use genetic algorithms or programing to generate music, poetry, or digital paintings. 

- Learn about and implement Multi-objective Genetic Algorithms to evolve a set of solutions to a real world problem that interests you. For example, explore Open Data from data.gov to see if you can evolve better local or global policies! 

- Evolve stock market or cryptocurrency prediction/trading algorithms.
